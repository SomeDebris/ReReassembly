 ...and it still is the superiour #Rebalanced Reassembly. All vanilla, but all balanced the way we deserve.
 
 CLAIMER:
 —) There weren't ANY changes throughout updates that would make the older .txt IRRELEVANT, but it's now worth noting that:
 
 
 
 
 1) Quite some work has been done to tweak and optimize all launchibles slightly more in the last Launchibles pass, especially the Nuke; 
 
 2) The "Macroscopic explosions and microscopic exposions" pass was the most significant, though it was very long time ago:
    to be short: all vanilla cores health is now the second layer, 
	shieldless playable factions' cores that are known to be durable can now tank one nuke explosion layer,
	surpassing vanilla core health produces same damage feedback as on Borg Drones,
	the new more durable first layer has a very specific amount of health, such as Red's core that perfectly survives a single Plasma Mortar explosion;
	other difficult to understand stuff, such as EXR-1 Railgun surviving own shot with 0 health left, and Shards not capable of killing blocks with same health, except if collided directly. Because reasons.
	
 3) Plasma Mortar frag upgrade: if landed a significant distance away from armour, outer frags will deal severe damage. In return even more extra power usage;
 
 4) Annihilator now deals a good deal of additional damage specifically to one block that it did not destroy upon impact. Thus sentinel finally has an anti-tank counter now that isn't just a Nuke,
    since their Gauss already spent it's role on anti-light ship, that also counters Shields unlike Obliterator;
	
 5) Together with that one ↑ I've also increased usability of low-durability hull varients. Check out your high-regen-rate options like Auxiliary sentinel hull! Or even Penrose Zero on Red!
	
 6) Mines now have a fun little blinker. Great for optimization, reduces maximum clutter as more mines near enemy will jump into action. In return the launcher is no longer this unreasonably light for it's 1225hp;
 
 7) Everything feels extra violent when it comes to explosions, note comparing Obliterator.
 
 8) Also all lasers turn much slower to reduce the redline counter versus Extremely Light ships, except Borg's already slow lasers, and Bee Drone turreted lasers, those two were not changed.
    Note that this also makes them not that much of a magnum opus at PD job, so do maybe give a shot to your explosive weaponry at it even if they're not Proximity!
	
 9) 2 more big vanilla-esque Tinkrell ships (C-2 and D-2) that, as all additional #Re ships do, exist merely to demonstrate a loadout type.
 
 10) Minor oversight fixes, I'd be saddened if someone got distraught by any.

 Fun fact: Reassembly Remastered was the first relatively public mod to use freely colourable font on title, even though it messed up the rest of texts.
